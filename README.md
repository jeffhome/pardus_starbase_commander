# Pardus Starbase Commander
A collection of tools for use by Starbase Commanders in Pardus (a MMORPG set in space).

## What is this?

This is a web extension that extends either Firefox or Chrome, adding some extra functionality for Starbase Commanders to assist them in successfully running their Starbase.

## Why have you made it?

After the release of Firefox v57 (Quantum) and the changes required for existing userscripts, I decided to bypass the likes of TamperMonkey and Greasemonkey by bundling my userscript functionality into a natice web extension.

## What am I supposed to do with it?

You can clone this repository and use the `build.sh` script to build the extension (for either Chrome, Firefox, or for both).

You might instead want to get the latest version from the following:

 * [Mozilla Addons - Pardus Starbase Commander](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/pardus-starbase-commander/) (Firefox)
 * [Chrome Store - Pardus Starbase Commander](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pardus-starbase-commander/ipddggkkdkdbkglpjenmpfieailhchhg/) (Chrome)

And unless you are playing [Pardus - a MMORPG set in space](http://www.pardus.at/) and are a Starbase Commander, then you will find this web extension of little use.
